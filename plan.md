# Prompts

- I want to integrate detShap pruning to this, use clean modular and readable code, keep both models and give me whole comparison of normal yolo v8 and detShap pruned one, i want all metrics comparison between both models
- also dont modify existing code blocks at all, add new ones and keep clear headers so that i can differentiate new ones
-
